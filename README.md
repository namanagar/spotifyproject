# spotify project
This is my final project for my AP Computer Science clas built using the Java wrapper for the Spotify API created by @thelinmichael

### what it does

- [x] Type in a song title and receive a playlist of length (up to 210) specified of songs you'd like
- [x] Type in an artist title and receive a playlist of length (up to 210) specified of songs you'd like
- [x] Type in an artist title and receive a list of other artists you'd like, and an option to see 10 songs by any of those related artists
- [ ] Actually create a Spotify playlist in your account with the given tracks. (Broken because of a known issue in the API wrapper)

### known issues

Something in the Maven setup isn't right so the program doesn't run properly when executed as a jar from a command line, but the project works when run from an IDE. (Probably something with the dependencies)
