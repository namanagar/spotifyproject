# spotify project
This is my final project for my AP Computer Science clas built using the Java wrapper for the Spotify API created by @thelinmichael found here: https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java

### what it does

- [x] Type in a song title and receive a playlist of length specified (up to 210) of songs you'd like
- [x] Type in an artist title and receive a playlist of length specified (up to 210) of songs you'd like
- [x] Type in an artist title and receive a list of other artists you'd like, and an option to see 10 songs by any of those reccomended artists
- [ ] Actually create a Spotify playlist in your account with the given tracks. (Broken because of a known issue in the API wrapper)

### how to use 

To run this program, use the command `$ java -cp target/spotifyproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar SpotifyDriver` in a command prompt/terminal from the working directory `spotifyproject`. The entire project is run through the CLI.
